== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to set up the 'call' and 'email' buttons =

After installing the plugin, click on Mobile Nav Settings in the sidebar. On this page, insert your email address and phone number.

= How to use icons on accordion menu =

To do so, you simply need to insert the icon code infront of the actual menu item's Navigation Label. The icon code is <i class="fa fa-iconname"></i>, where "fa-iconname" can be replaced with an icon name available on this cheat sheet here: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/

For example, let's say you want to link to your Twitter account. In that case, the full Navigation Label can be: <i class="fa fa-twitter"></i>Twitter

Or perhaps you'd like to link to page that lists your podcasts. In case, this would work: <i class="fa fa-microphone"></i>Podcasts
Or, as a final example, you wish to link to a gallery page: <i class="fa fa-camera-retro"></i>Image gallery

Icons can be added to both top-level and sub-menu items.

= Adding a descriptive sub-menu item ("text" class) =

To add a text-only sub-menu item to your menu (great for short intros, descriptions etc..), all you have to do is give the menu item the "text" class. To do so, simply write "text" into the sub-menu item's "CSS Classes (optional)" field (you may need to enable that field by clicking on "Screen Options" in the top right corner of the screen and then ticking "CSS Classes").

And that's all there is to it. Now whatever you type into the "Navigation Label" field will be formatted into a description.
